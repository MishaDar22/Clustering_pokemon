# Clustering_pokemon
In this project, I want to show how to find the optimal number of Pokemon groups based on their parameters using the 'elbow' method and the 'silhouette' method. Then I divided Pokemon into groups using k-means and DBSCAN method. I also describe step by step my experience about the work I have done.

## Data set
[Pokemon.csv](http://staff.ii.pw.edu.pl/~rbembeni/dane/Pokemon.csv)

## Language
**R**

## Libraries

## Algorithms
k-means, Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN)
